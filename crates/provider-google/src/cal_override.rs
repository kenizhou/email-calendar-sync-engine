//! Reading the entries Google returns for occurrences the user changed, and folding them
//! into the series they belong to.
//!
//! With `singleEvents=false` a series comes back as the **master** plus one entry per
//! occurrence somebody touched — each carrying `recurringEventId` (the master's id) and
//! `originalStartTime` (which occurrence), and a cancelled one carrying
//! `status: "cancelled"` as well. That is the same information CalDAV states as a
//! `RECURRENCE-ID` `VEVENT` and JSCalendar as a `recurrenceOverrides` entry, so it folds into
//! the same [`Recurrence::overrides`] map and the expander sees one representation.
//!
//! # Why the folding happens after the whole pass, not per entry
//!
//! An entry names its master by id, and nothing orders the two: the master may be on an
//! earlier page, a later one, or — on a delta — not present at all. So the entries are
//! collected as they are read and folded once every page is in.
//!
//! **A delta that changes an occurrence carries its master too**, measured: overriding one
//! occurrence and cancelling another bumped the master's `updated`, and all three arrived in
//! the next `syncToken` response. An entry whose master is nowhere in the pass is therefore
//! dropped rather than chased — the recovery would be two more requests (`events.get` for the
//! master's `iCalUID`, then `events.list?iCalUID=` for the series, which does return the
//! master and every override) for a case the server has not been seen to produce.
