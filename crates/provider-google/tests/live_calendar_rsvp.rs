//! Gated live **RSVP** checks against a real Google account: answering an invitation over
//! `events.patch`, what `sendUpdates` is, and how the answer reads back. Skips unless
//! `GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set.
//!
//! ```sh
//! GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN="$(cargo run -q --manifest-path tools/google-oauth/Cargo.toml -- token)" \
//!   cargo test -p provider-google --test live_calendar_rsvp -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the invitation is seeded with `events.import`
//!
//! An RSVP is only itself when somebody *else* organizes the meeting, and a single test
//! account cannot be invited by a second party without mailing one. `events.import` is
//! Google's answer to exactly that: it places an event on the calendar with an
//! `organizer` the account is not, and the account as a `needsAction` attendee — no
//! invitation is sent, to anyone, and the `iCalUID` is preserved (`events.insert` mints its
//! own). So the fixture costs no mail and the thing under test is a genuine invitation.
//!
//! The adapter has no import verb and should not grow one — importing is a migration tool,
//! not a sync verb — so the seed is a direct HTTP call, the same exception
//! `provider-caldav`'s scheduling suite makes for a seeded document. **Every assertion is
//! about what the adapter did.**
//!
//! # What only the live API can settle
//!
//! 1. `sendUpdates` is a **query** parameter. In the body it is silently ignored: the patch still
//!    succeeds and the organizer is simply never told. No offline fake can tell those two apart.
//! 2. A **one-element** `attendees` array is read as "this attendee answered" and leaves the other
//!    guests alone — the safety claim `cal_write::rsvp_event` rests on. It is true *for an
//!    attendee*; [`live_rsvp_as_the_organizer_truncates_the_guest_list`] pins the case where it is
//!    not.
//! 3. The answer that reads back. Google names the organizer twice — the `organizer` object and an
//!    `attendees[]` entry — and a projection that emitted both would report the organizer's implied
//!    `accepted` beside the real answer, for the same address. That is not hypothetical: it is the
//!    bug this suite was written to catch, and it made an earlier RSVP test look like a broken
//!    *write* (the status appeared frozen at whatever the read happened to pick) when every patch
//!    had in fact landed.
//!
//! Nothing here emails anybody: every answer is `quietly()` (`sendUpdates=none`) and the
//! seeded organizer is a reserved `example.test` address. Each test cleans up its own event.
