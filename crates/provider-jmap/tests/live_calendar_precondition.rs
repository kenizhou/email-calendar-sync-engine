//! Gated live proof of *why* this adapter sends no `ifInState`, on the one question no test
//! that drives the adapter can reach. Skips with no `STALWART_HTTP_ADDR`.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! `provider-jmap` advertises [`WriteGuard::Absent`] for calendar writes. The sibling
//! `a_stale_edit_is_not_refused` pins that from the adapter side, and is explicit about its
//! blind spot: it sends no precondition, so it cannot observe what the server does with one.
//! Nothing in the repo could, because the adapter has no way to express `ifInState` — by
//! design. That left the *reason* for the design sitting in prose, which is how a claim about
//! it went unverified across two releases (issue #93).
//!
//! This file closes that, over the harness's raw JMAP seam (`Harness::jmap_post`).
//!
//! # What it proves, and why it argues *against* sending `ifInState`
//!
//! Stalwart v0.16.14+ (the harness pins **v0.16.21**) enforces `ifInState` correctly: a
//! superseded token is refused with `stateMismatch` and the write does not land. So the
//! objection is **not** "the server ignores it" — it honours it exactly as RFC 8620 §5.3
//! specifies, and that is the problem.
//!
//! §5.3 scopes the token to the account's whole `CalendarEvent` **type state**, not to the
//! object being written. [`ifinstate_refuses_a_write_because_an_unrelated_event_changed`]
//! demonstrates the consequence against the real server: hold a state, let a *different*
//! property of a *different* event change, and a write to an event **nobody touched** is
//! refused. For a sync engine holding a cursor while the account keeps moving underneath it —
//! an incoming invitation, another device, a series materializing — that is not lost-update
//! protection, it is a write that fails on unrelated activity.
//!
//! So `ifInState` is the wrong *instrument*, independent of how well a server implements it,
//! and there is no right one here: a `CalendarEvent` carries no per-object revision (no
//! `ETag`, no `changeKey`), so `RevisionTokens` is empty for every JMAP object by
//! construction. There is nothing to name *this event's* version with. `jmap.md` is
//! authoritative; this is its executable half.
//!
//! **If this test starts failing**, the server stopped enforcing or changed the scope — read
//! `jmap.md`'s "no per-object revision" section before concluding anything about the adapter.
