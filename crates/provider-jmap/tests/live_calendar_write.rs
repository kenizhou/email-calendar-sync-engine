//! Gated live `CalendarEvent/set` checks against the Stalwart harness, mirroring the CalDAV
//! write suite (`provider-caldav/tests/common/write.rs`). Skips with no `STALWART_HTTP_ADDR`.
//!
//! Writes are where a live server is not optional. The offline `FakeExecutor` serves canned
//! bytes **whatever it is sent**, so a `CalendarEvent/set` with a bad JSON-pointer or a
//! malformed JSCalendar object passes every offline test and fails against a real server
//! (`AGENTS.md`). These answer what only a server can:
//!
//! - [`round_trip`] — does a create/patch/destroy actually land, and does the **server** hand back
//!   the id it assigned?
//! - [`partial_update_is_merged_by_the_server`] — the finding this whole adapter is built on. An
//!   `update` of one property must leave every other one alone. If Stalwart replaced the object
//!   instead of merging the patch, editing a title would silently wipe the event's zone, duration
//!   and recurrence — and no offline test would notice, because there is no document on our side to
//!   compare against.
//! - [`a_stale_edit_is_not_refused`] — the honesty check. It asserts the *absence* of a lost-update
//!   guard, which is what [`WriteGuard::Absent`] claims: the claim is pinned to observed behaviour,
//!   not to a reading of the spec. Note what it is blind to — it drives the adapter, which sends no
//!   precondition, so it cannot notice the server *gaining* one. Stalwart v0.16.14 started
//!   enforcing `ifInState` and this test passes unchanged on the pinned v0.16.21; see the test's
//!   own docs.
//! - [`recurrence_override_edit`] — is a `recurrenceOverrides/<start>/…` pointer accepted, and does
//!   the server materialize the override itself?
//!
//! Every scenario leaves the seeded calendar exactly as it found it.
