//! Gated live **scheduling** checks against the Stalwart harness: what a JMAP calendar write
//! makes the server tell the other party. Skips with no `STALWART_HTTP_ADDR`.
//!
//! These are the JMAP writes the offline suite structurally cannot judge. An RSVP sends a
//! **JSON-pointer patch** — `participants/<id>/participationStatus` — whose pointer is a map
//! key the engine's projection has already thrown away, so the adapter has to recover it
//! from the preserved `raw_jscalendar`. And whether a `/set` causes an iTIP message at all is
//! a thing the *server* does to a *second account's* copy. The offline `FakeExecutor` answers
//! canned bytes whatever it is sent (`AGENTS.md`), so a pointer that escapes the key wrongly,
//! names a participant that does not exist, or a request that quietly notifies nobody passes
//! every offline test. Only a real server can say.
//!
//! The two-party fixture is [`scheduling`].
//!
//! # Scheduling is opt-in, and this suite used to pin our own omission as a server gap
//!
//! For several months this suite asserted that a JMAP answer *never* reaches the organizer,
//! and attributed it to Stalwart. That was wrong, and the way it was wrong is why these docs
//! are this long.
//!
//! `sendSchedulingMessages` (draft-ietf-jmap-calendars §5.3, default **`false`**) is what
//! makes a server derive an iTIP message from a `/set`. The adapter never sent it. So the
//! server did exactly what it was asked — store the change, tell nobody — and the test
//! recorded that silence as *Stalwart's* behaviour, because the only request shape it ever
//! sent was the one the adapter builds. Isolated on one event, same participant, same
//! server, seconds apart:
//!
//! | attendee RSVPs over JMAP | organizer's copy after 8s |
//! |---|---|
//! | **without** `sendSchedulingMessages` | stays `NEEDS-ACTION` — no `REPLY` |
//! | **with** `sendSchedulingMessages: true` | `DECLINED` — `REPLY` delivered |
//!
//! The CalDAV control arm made it worse rather than better: it "worked", which looked like
//! proof the difference was server-side, when in fact CalDAV auto-schedules per RFC 6638 and
//! has no equivalent opt-in — so the two arms were never comparable. This is the `AGENTS.md`
//! "offline fakes cannot catch a wrong request shape" trap hit *with* a live server, because
//! one shape was all that was ever sent.
//!
//! **The rule that follows, and the reason both directions are tested:** a live test that
//! asserts an absence must first prove the absence is not caused by something we failed to
//! send. [`jmap_rsvp_reaches_the_organizer`] asserts the `REPLY` arrives and
//! [`jmap_a_quiet_answer_reaches_nobody`] asserts it does not when the flag is off, so the
//! flag's effect is pinned from both sides and neither result can be produced by a stuck
//! adapter. [`jmap_cancelling_a_meeting_reaches_the_attendee`] does the same job for the
//! write verbs, which carry the flag unconditionally.
//!
//! The full history is #102 (which inverts #93). The harness pins **v0.16.21**.
//!
//! Every scenario leaves the harness exactly as it found it.

/// 1. Stalwart **accepts** the `participants/<id>/participationStatus` pointer — the id recovered

///    not model, is left alone. A replace would wipe the organizer off the event.
/// 3. The one control JMAP cannot honour — a note — is refused **before** anything is written.
/// 4. The iTIP `REPLY` reaches the organizer's copy, in another account we never wrote to. This is
