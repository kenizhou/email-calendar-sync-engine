//! The two-party fixture the live scheduling scenarios share: a real invitation between two
//! real accounts on the Stalwart harness, placed over CalDAV and worked over JMAP.
//!
//! # Why the invitation is seeded over CalDAV
//!
//! JMAP has no whole-document write, and `EventDraft` cannot state an `ORGANIZER`/`ATTENDEE`
//! pair — so there is no way to *create* an invitation over JMAP alone. The organizer's copy
//! is therefore placed with a CalDAV `PUT`, exactly as `provider-caldav`'s scheduling
//! fixture does, and Stalwart's RFC 6638 auto-scheduling delivers it to the attendee. That
//! is the counterparty's fixture, not the thing under test: **every assertion in the
//! scenarios is about what JMAP did**.
//!
//! It also makes the tests stronger than same-protocol ones would be. The invitation arrives
//! by one protocol and is worked by another, against one server — so the participant ids the
//! JMAP projection sees really do address the resource CalDAV wrote, and the two protocols'
//! scheduling behaviour can be compared with everything else held constant.
//!
//! The organizer therefore holds **both** clients: CalDAV to place the invitation, JMAP for
//! the scenario that has them cancel it.
