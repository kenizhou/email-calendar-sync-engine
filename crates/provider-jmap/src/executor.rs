//! The execution seam: one trait for "send this batched JMAP request", implemented by the
//! live client and, in tests, by a fake fed captured response documents.
//!
//! Its own module rather than part of [`provider`](crate::provider) because it is what makes
//! the whole adapter testable offline: every fetch, write and submission path is written
//! against this trait, so the orchestration is exercised against real Stalwart bytes with no
//! network. The provider is one of its callers, not its owner.
