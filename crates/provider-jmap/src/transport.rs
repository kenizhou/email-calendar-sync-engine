//! reqwest-backed HTTP transport for JMAP.
//!
//! Thin wrapper that applies authentication, ships the JSON envelope, and maps
//! HTTP/transport failures into [`JmapError`]. Redirects are **not** auto-followed:
//! the session-discovery flow in [`crate`] resolves the well-known redirect itself
//! so it can rebase a foreign advertised origin onto the connection (see
//! [`SessionUrlPolicy`](crate::SessionUrlPolicy)).
