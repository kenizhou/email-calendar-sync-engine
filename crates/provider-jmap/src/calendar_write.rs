//! Calendar writes via `CalendarEvent/set` (RFC 8620 §5.3, JSCalendar RFC 8984): create,
//! patch, destroy. The fourth verb, the RSVP, is [`calendar_rsvp`](crate::calendar_rsvp) —
//! it alone has to resolve a participant id out of the preserved JSCalendar.
//!
//! This is how JMAP renders the neutral write verbs (`engine-provider`), and it is the
//! mirror image of CalDAV's. CalDAV's write verb is `PUT` — replace the whole resource — so
//! the *client* has to do the surgery (`provider_caldav`'s structural iCalendar patcher).
//! JMAP's `update` **is already a patch**: a PatchObject keyed by JSON pointer, which the
//! **server** merges into the stored object. We probed this against the harness rather than
//! assuming it: an `update` of `title` alone left `timeZone`, `duration`, `uid` and `start`
//! untouched. So this module never rewrites a document — it translates intent into pointers,
//! and there is no JSCalendar serializer to keep in step with the parser.
//!
//! The `raw_jscalendar` preserved on read ([`calendar`](crate::calendar)) is therefore not
//! the *target* of the surgery here, as `raw_ical` is on CalDAV, but it is still consulted:
//! a location edit needs the id of the location already on the event, and that id lives
//! only in the provider-native payload.
//!
//! # There is no lost-update guard on this transport
//!
//! [`WriteGuard::Absent`](engine_provider::WriteGuard::Absent), and deliberately so. Two
//! independent reasons, both established rather than assumed:
//!
//! 1. **A `CalendarEvent` carries no per-object revision.** No `ETag`, no `changeKey` —
//!    `RevisionTokens` is empty for every JMAP object by construction. There is simply nothing to
//!    guard *this event* with.
//! 2. **`ifInState` is the wrong instrument, not merely a broken one.** RFC 8620 §5.3 scopes it to
//!    the account's whole `CalendarEvent` **type state**, not to the object: on a spec-compliant
//!    server, guarding an edit of *my* event with it means the write is rejected because somebody
//!    added an *unrelated* meeting since my last sync. That is not lost-update protection, it is a
//!    spurious failure — and the value would have to be the sync cursor, which is a property of the
//!    sync, not of the event being written.
//!
//! Stalwart's own handling of it changed under us, and neither state changes the above.
//! v0.16.11 through v0.16.13 parsed `ifInState` and never compared it (a stale-state `/set`
//! was applied and returned a fresh `newState`, where RFC 8620 §5.3 requires a
//! `stateMismatch`); v0.16.14 fixed that, and the harness pins v0.16.21 — so a
//! stale-but-well-formed token is refused with `stateMismatch` and the write does not land on
//! the server our live tests meet. Which only sharpens reason 2: the probe's state had moved
//! because of an edit to a *different* property of a *different* event, exactly the spurious
//! rejection a per-event guard must not have.
//!
//! So sending `ifInState` would buy nothing on the server we run against and would cause
//! spurious rejections on one that behaved. We send none, and say so through the capability
//! — the one thing that must not happen is a write API that *looks* like it gives optimistic
//! concurrency everywhere when here it gives none (`jmap.md`).
