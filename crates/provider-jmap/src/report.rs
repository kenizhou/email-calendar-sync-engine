//! Reporting a message as junk / not junk / phishing via `Email/set` (RFC 8621 §4.6).
//!
//! JMAP has no report *action*. The report is the IANA-registered keyword — `$junk`,
//! `$notjunk`, `$phishing` (RFC 8621 §4.1.1, RFC 9979) — and RFC 8621 says clients
//! SHOULD set it "to help train automated spam-detection systems". That is a
//! client-side SHOULD with no server obligation, no capability to probe and no error
//! if the server ignores it, so the adapter advertises
//! [`ReportEvidence::Convention`]: verified against Stalwart, the keyword is stored
//! and read back, and nothing in the protocol says what was done with it.
//!
//! Both halves ride **one** `Email/set` — the keyword patch and the `mailboxIds`
//! replacement that files the message — so a report and its move cannot land
//! half-applied and cost one round-trip. Live-verified against the harness.
//!
//! The contradicting keyword is cleared in the same patch. Leaving `$notjunk` set
//! while setting `$junk` would store a message that is asserted to be both, and which
//! of the two a server's classifier then believes is not something a client should be
//! deciding by accident.
