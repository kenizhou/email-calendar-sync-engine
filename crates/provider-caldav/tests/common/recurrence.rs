//! Live CalDAV scenario: creating a **recurring** event, and reading the rule back.
//!
//! Its own file rather than an addition to [`write`](super::write), which is already close
//! to the 500-line cap.
//!
//! What only a real server can settle: the offline suite proves the `RRULE` line we build,
//! but `MockStream` answers canned bytes whatever it is sent (`AGENTS.md`), so nothing
//! offline says Stalwart accepts the document. And Stalwart **reserializes** what it stores
//! — it reorders `RRULE` parts — so a read-back is the only evidence the rule survived as a
//! *rule* rather than as bytes.
