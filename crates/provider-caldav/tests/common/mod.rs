//! Shared helpers for the gated live CalDAV suites (Stalwart and SabreDAV).
//!
//! Both servers run the **same** write scenarios ([`write`]), so the client is proven
//! not over-fit to one implementation — the insurance the read tests already give
//! discovery + sync-token, extended to conditional `PUT`/`DELETE` and to the
//! structural patcher.
//!
//! The two servers are *not* interchangeable as evidence, and the difference is the
//! reason the preservation check is written the way it is:
//!
//! - **SabreDAV stores the bytes verbatim** — what you `PUT` is what you `GET`.
//! - **Stalwart reserializes** — it keeps every property but re-folds content lines and reorders
//!   `RRULE` parts, so the document it hands back is *not* the one you sent.
//!
//! So a preservation assertion can never compare our bytes with the server's. It
//! compares the **server's own copy before the patch** with the **server's own copy
//! after it**: whatever the server does to the formatting it does to both, and anything
//! it *drops* shows up as a missing line. See [`write::patched_update_preserves_the_document`].
