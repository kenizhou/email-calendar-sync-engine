//! The live scenarios for issue #105: what an account needs when its calendar server does
//! **not** schedule for it.
//!
//! Both run against every real server the harness offers, and the pair is the point —
//! `scheduling_is_discovered_from_the_server` is the one assertion in this repo whose
//! expected value *differs between the two servers*, because it is reading a property of
//! the server rather than of the protocol. Stalwart advertises RFC 6638; the SabreDAV
//! fixture serves calendar access only. A fake cannot stand in for either: it answers
//! canned bytes without reading the request, so it could never tell us that a real
//! `OPTIONS` is answered at all, let alone what a real server puts in its `DAV:` header.
//!
//! [`storing_an_invitation_is_a_guarded_create`] is the other half. Putting the meeting on
//! the calendar has to be a create-if-absent, and only a server can tell us that
//! `If-None-Match: *` is honoured on a `PUT` — that a second one is refused rather than
//! silently overwriting the copy that is now there.
