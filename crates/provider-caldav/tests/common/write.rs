//! The live CalDAV **write** scenarios, run against every real server the harness
//! offers. Each one answers a question an offline fake structurally cannot, because a
//! fake replays canned bytes without ever reading the request:
//!
//! - [`round_trip`] — does the `PUT` hand back the new `ETag`, and is it the resource's real one
//!   (i.e. usable as the next precondition with no refetch)?
//! - [`patched_update_preserves_the_document`] — does an edit made through the neutral patch verb
//!   survive the **server**? Our byte-equality tests prove the *patcher* keeps the `RRULE`, the
//!   `VALARM`, the `VTIMEZONE` and the `X-` properties; they say nothing about whether the server
//!   stores them or quietly normalizes them away.
//! - [`stale_if_match_is_a_conflict`] — does a superseded guard really come back `412`, and does
//!   the adapter class it `Conflict` (refetch-and-merge) rather than a blind-retryable `Retryable`?
//! - [`instance_override_split_is_accepted`] — does a `RECURRENCE-ID` override the patcher splits
//!   out of a master get accepted as part of the same resource, and come back folded into one
//!   event?
//!
//! They are written the way a **host** writes: state the intent through the neutral verbs
//! (`engine_provider::EventDraft`/`EventEdit`) and never assemble iCalendar. The one
//! exception is seeding a fixture too rich for a draft to express (a `VTIMEZONE`, a
//! `VALARM`, an `RRULE`), which goes in through the whole-document verb — that is the
//! server-side fixture, not the thing under test.
//!
//! Every scenario leaves the seeded collection exactly as it found it.
