//! What an auto-scheduling server reports back about the reply it sent for us — the
//! `EventWriteReceipt::reply_delivery` half of an RSVP.
//!
//! The two-party fixture is the parent module ([`super`]); read its docs first.
//!
//! # Why this scenario asserts an absence, and how it earns the right to
//!
//! Stalwart writes **no** `ORGANIZER;SCHEDULE-STATUS` on the attendee's copy — verified here
//! and by direct DAV probing, on a delivered reply *and* with an unreachable organizer. So
//! the receipt is [`ReplyDelivery::NotReported`], and this test's headline assertion is that
//! something is *missing*.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` is explicit that such a test has to prove the absence is the server's and not
//! ours, because "we never sent it" produces the identical observation. The proof is the
//! control below: the organizer's **separate** copy is polled until it shows
//! `PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED`, which can only happen if the reply was actually delivered. So the
//! pair reads *"the reply arrived **and** the server said nothing about it"* — which is a
//! server behaviour — rather than *"nothing happened"*, which would be a broken adapter.
//!
//! That distinction is the entire reason [`ReplyDelivery`] has three states instead of two:
//! a real deployment (Soverin, SabreDAV + `Schedule`) reports `5.2` on this exact property
//! and delivers nothing, so silence here cannot be read as either outcome.
