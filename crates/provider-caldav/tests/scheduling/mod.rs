//! The live **CalDAV scheduling** scenarios (RFC 6638 auto-schedule): a real invitation
//! travelling between two real accounts on a real server.
//!
//! `calendar-semantics.md` makes a claim no offline test can reach: on a CalDAV
//! auto-schedule server, patching my `PARTSTAT` into the stored resource and `PUT`ting it
//! back **is** the whole RSVP — the server derives the iTIP `REPLY` and delivers it to the
//! organizer, so the client needs no separate delivery step. A fake cannot answer that,
//! because the reply is a thing the *server* does to a *second account's* copy in response
//! to bytes we sent. That claim is [`an_rsvp_reaches_the_organizer`], and it is why this
//! file exists.
//!
//! Stalwart is the only harness server that can run these: it advertises
//! `calendar-auto-schedule` on the calendar home and exposes
//! `CALDAV:schedule-inbox-URL`, and the harness provisions the accounts to be the two
//! parties. The SabreDAV fixture has one principal and no scheduling plugin, so — unlike
//! the write scenarios, which deliberately run against both — this module is declared only
//! by `live_caldav.rs`.
//!
//! **What the server does, observed rather than assumed.** When the organizer `PUT`s an
//! event naming an attendee, Stalwart does three separate things: deposits a
//! `METHOD:REQUEST` in the attendee's scheduling inbox, **adds the event to the attendee's
//! own calendar** already carrying `PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION`, and **mails** the attendee an
//! iMIP invitation. The attendee's copy therefore appears at a **server-minted href**,
//! never at `<uid>.ics`, which is why every read here goes through a re-sync by `UID`.
//!
//! That third delivery is why both parties here are the harness's **scratch** accounts and
//! neither is the seeded one. The mail is a genuine side effect we cannot switch off, it
//! reaches the *organizer* too (a `REPLY` arrives as "Accepted:…"), and the mail suites
//! assert an exact INBOX count on the seeded account — so a run involving Alice would
//! leave her INBOX permanently over count. Off to the side, nothing counts what we deliver.
//!
//! Each scenario cleans up both calendar copies and **both parties'** scheduling-inbox
//! messages, so a re-run starts from the same state. Both, because scheduling runs both ways:
//! the attendee is sent a `REQUEST` and the organizer is sent a `REPLY`, and sweeping only the
//! attendee left the organizer's inbox growing by two per run. [`cleanup_leaves_no_residue`]
//! is the check that keeps it that way.
//!
//! **The harness has to disarm a rate limiter for this to be re-runnable.** Stalwart ships an
//! inbound throttle of 25 messages/hour per (sender domain, recipient), and auto-scheduling
//! mails *both* parties of every invitation — so this suite used to die after about four runs,
//! and it died *silently*: past the cap the server abandons the whole iTIP delivery, the
//! attendee's calendar copy included, while still answering the organizer's `PUT` with `201`.
//! The harness entrypoint now raises the inbound throttles at bootstrap
//! (`x:MtaInboundThrottle`, see `docker/stalwart/entrypoint.sh`). If these tests ever start
//! timing out on delivery again, check that first — [`poll_until`] says how.
