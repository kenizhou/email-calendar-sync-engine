//! The [`Provider`] implementation, wiring CalDAV discovery and `sync-collection`
//! into the engine's generic calendar sync.
//!
//! Like an [`ImapProvider`](provider_imap), a `CalDavProvider` is **bound to one
//! calendar collection** for events ([`event_scope`](Provider::event_scope) is
//! that collection's [`DavCollection`](engine_core::sync::SyncScope::DavCollection)),
//! while [`sync_calendars`](Provider::sync_calendars) lists *all* of the account's
//! calendars under the per-account
//! [`DavCollectionList`](engine_core::sync::SyncScope::DavCollectionList) container
//! scope. The collection list is re-snapshotted each pass (no list cursor),
//! exactly as IMAP re-`LIST`s its folders. The cross-collection fan-out (drive
//! every calendar) is the later orchestrator's job. The provider advertises
//! [`Capabilities::calendars`] **and** [`Capabilities::calendar_writes`] — it both
//! reads/syncs and writes (`PUT`/`DELETE`) over the same HTTP transport (`write`);
//! the mail methods keep their unsupported defaults.
