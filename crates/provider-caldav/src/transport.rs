//! The HTTP transport and the [`DavExecutor`] seam.
//!
//! Every CalDAV request the adapter makes goes through [`DavExecutor`], so the
//! discovery/sync orchestration is unit-tested offline by replaying captured
//! response bodies (mirroring `provider-jmap`'s `Executor`). The live
//! implementation, [`DavClient`], is a thin `reqwest` wrapper: it applies
//! authentication, sends the `PROPFIND`/`REPORT` method with a `Depth` header and
//! XML body, and — like the JMAP transport — **does not auto-follow redirects**,
//! so discovery can resolve the RFC 6764 well-known `307` itself.
