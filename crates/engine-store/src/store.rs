//! The async `Store` trait and a minimal read surface.
//!
//! `store-and-sync.md` is authoritative for the concurrency model. `Store` is the
//! writer/lease/outbox half: one effective writer per scope and per in-flight op,
//! enforced by a store-issued fencing token re-checked inside the write
//! transaction. [`StoreRead`] is the small inspection surface the contract suite
//! (and, later, query execution) needs; the full search read path is a separate
//! sub-step.
//!
//! The trait is generic over the object type via [`Keyed`], so the store
//! stays mechanical and type-erased at the row level and the contract suite can
//! run on any object. It is consumed as `S: Store` (not `dyn Store`), since the
//! store sits behind `engine-api`.
