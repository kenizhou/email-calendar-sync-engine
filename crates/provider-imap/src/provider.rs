//! The [`Provider`] implementation: an [`ImapProvider`] bound to one mailbox for
//! email, syncing the account's folder list under the per-account
//! [`SyncScope::ImapMailboxList`].
//!
//! The connection is stateful (one TLS socket, sequential commands), so it is held
//! behind an async [`Mutex`] — concurrent `stream_email` calls serialize onto
//! the one IMAP session, which is exactly IMAP's model. Method execution is generic
//! over the stream, so the offline tests drive the full `Provider` surface over a
//! mock while [`ImapProvider::connect`] uses a `tokio-rustls` TLS stream.
