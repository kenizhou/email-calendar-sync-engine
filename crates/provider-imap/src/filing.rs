//! SMTP submission + IMAP `APPEND` filing of sent copies and drafts.
//!
//! The submission *conversation* lives in [`crate::smtp`] and the `APPEND` itself in
//! [`crate::place`]; this module is the `Provider`-side glue that runs the send and then
//! files the resulting copy into the account's real Sent/Drafts folder. It is the
//! [`ImapProvider`] half that `submit_email` delegates to (the caller-rendered-bytes
//! variant, `submit_email_source`, lives in [`crate::smtp_source`] over the same filing
//! helpers), kept out of [`crate::provider`] so that file stays under the size limit.
//!
//! **Delivering and filing are two operations, and the second one can fail on its own.**
//! SMTP dials a fresh connection per send, so a delivery succeeds over a session that has
//! been idle for an hour; the `APPEND` rides the provider's standing IMAP session, which by
//! then may be dead. That asymmetry is not hypothetical: it delivers the mail and loses the
//! sender's copy, with nothing to reconcile against later. The response is `file_sent_copy`:
//! retry once on a
//! freshly dialed session, and when even that cannot file it, say so in the receipt
//! ([`engine_provider::SentCopy::Unfiled`]) — this crate emits no logs of its own, so the
//! outcome travelling up *is* the diagnostic. What it must never do is fail the send: the
//! mail is already gone, and a caller that treated filing as delivery would re-send it.
