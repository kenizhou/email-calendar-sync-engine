//! Forward-only schema migrations, keyed on `PRAGMA user_version`.
//!
//! `user_version` is a free integer in the SQLite database header (no extra
//! table). On open, [`migrate`] reads it, runs every not-yet-applied step in
//! order — each in its own transaction so a step and its version bump commit
//! atomically — and stops. A fresh database is at version 0 and gets every step;
//! an up-to-date database is a no-op.
//!
//! **Forward-only.** There are no down-migrations: the store is a re-derivable
//! cache of provider data, so a reshaping change can drop and rebuild
//! `object`/`fts_doc`/`event_occurrence` (and force a re-sync) rather than copy
//! data forward — only `pending_op` holds non-re-derivable user writes and must
//! be migrated data-preservingly. Opening a database whose version is *newer*
//! than this build knows about is refused rather than silently mishandled.
//!
//! Re-deriving is cheap only when it costs a *local* pass. A step that would otherwise force a
//! re-**sync** — every message downloaded again over the network, which the user watches — carries
//! a [`backfill`](crate::backfill) step instead: it fills the new shape from `object`, which
//! already holds the normalized record, by running the engine's own projection over it.
//!
//! Postgres will use the same discipline later via a `schema_migrations` table
//! (it has no `user_version`); the migration SQL stays per-store because the
//! dialects differ, while the portable query layer lives in `engine-search`.
