//! `store-sqlite` — the durable SQLite backend for the PIM sync engine.
//!
//! [`SqliteStore`] implements the `engine-store` [`Store`] and
//! [`StoreRead`](engine_store::StoreRead)
//! contracts over SQLite, so it passes the shared `engine_store::contract` suite
//! the in-memory reference store passes. It is the first persistent store; other
//! backends are host adapters.
//!
//! Design (see `docs/agent-guidance/store-and-sync.md`):
//!
//! - **Mechanical.** The store writes the precomputed [`DerivedWrite`] and the opaque serialized
//!   objects keyed by provider key; it performs no normalization, text extraction, or recurrence
//!   expansion.
//! - **Fenced.** Each scope and op carries a monotonic generation; a write is admitted only if its
//!   lease token still equals the stored generation, re-checked inside the write transaction.
//! - **Encryption-agnostic.** At-rest protection is a *construction* detail (plain SQLite over OS
//!   file encryption by default; SQLCipher is an opt-in build), so the contract holds either way.
//!   Credentials never enter this store.
//! - **Async over sync.** rusqlite is synchronous; every call runs on a blocking thread via
//!   [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`]. A file database splits into one writer connection and a pool
//!   of `query_only` readers (`pool.rs`), so a committing sync and a list read no longer queue
//!   behind each other; an in-memory database keeps a single connection, because there each
//!   connection is its own database.
//!
//! The FTS5 search index and the normalized structured-filter tables layer over
//! this base in migration `V2` (`schema.rs`). On-demand message content (`V5`) splits
//! by *text vs bytes*: the raw message bytes live in a content-addressed filesystem
//! blob area (`blob.rs`) — never in SQLite — while the extracted body text and its
//! own lease-free FTS index live in `message_body`/`message_body_fts` (`source_ops.rs`).
