//! The durable schema, as versioned DDL.
//!
//! Each `const` here is one migration step's SQL; [`crate::migrations`] runs them
//! in order keyed on `PRAGMA user_version`. To evolve the schema, add a new `Vn`
//! const and append it to the migration list — never edit a shipped step, since
//! existing databases have already applied it.
//!
//! Five tables back the store contract. `sync_scope` holds the per-scope fencing
//! generation, lease expiry, and cursor; `object` holds the serialized normalized
//! payloads keyed by `(scope, provider key)`; `fts_doc` and `event_occurrence`
//! hold the precomputed derived rows (`DerivedWrite`); `pending_op` is the outbox.
//!
//! Derived rows are deliberately **not** foreign-keyed to `object`: maintenance
//! can index a body before its object row exists, and the reference store imposes
//! no such constraint either. The object→derived tombstone cascade is therefore
//! explicit (see `scope_ops::tombstone`), not a `FOREIGN KEY … ON DELETE CASCADE`.
//!
//! The search layer is migration [`v2`]: it reshapes `fts_doc` to carry a stable
//! integer rowid and typed text columns (`subject`/`body`/`location`), builds the
//! FTS5 external-content index over it, and adds the normalized structured-filter
//! tables and junctions plus the per-chunk embedding table.
//!
//! Migration [`V3`] adds `event_occurrence.tzdata_version`: the bundled IANA
//! tzdata release each occurrence was expanded under, so a tzdata-version bump can
//! find and re-expand exactly the affected occurrences (`calendar-semantics.md`).
//!
//! `STRICT` enforces column types; the composite-key tables are `WITHOUT ROWID`
//! (clustered by their key), while `pending_op` keeps a rowid so it maps onto
//! `PendingOpId`. Time is ISO-8601 `TEXT` (sortable and exact to nanoseconds);
//! generations and ids are `INTEGER`; opaque normalized payloads are `TEXT` JSON
//! (never queried in SQL — structured filters use derived columns, not payload
//! introspection — so JSONB would only cost debuggability and portability here).
