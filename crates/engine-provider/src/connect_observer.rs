//! What happened *while* an adapter established its connection.
//!
//! [`ConnectionInfo`](crate::ConnectionInfo) reports the **outcome** of a connect: it
//! is a sync, infallible fact accessor, so it can describe a connection only once one
//! exists. Everything that happened on the way there — the well-known `30x` hops JMAP
//! and CalDAV follow themselves, the TLS handshake, authentication, the endpoint
//! discovery settled on — used to be discarded when `connect` resolved. A
//! [`ConnectObserver`] receives those as they happen, so a host can log or surface
//! connection progress.
//!
//! The shape mirrors `engine-sync`'s `SyncObserver`: a trait, a blanket impl over
//! `Fn`, a no-op default ([`IgnoreConnectSteps`]), and a borrowed payload — the engine
//! allocates nothing and a host clones only what it keeps.
//!
//! # Steps, never states
//!
//! An adapter emits *steps*; it does not model a `Disconnected`/`Connecting`/`Connected`
//! state machine, because it cannot do so truthfully: three of the four adapters are
//! only constructible via a completed `connect()`, so `Connecting` is unobservable
//! through any accessor, and `connection_info()` is sync and infallible, so it cannot
//! detect a socket that has since died. A **host** owns that state machine — it is the
//! layer that knows a call just failed with
//! [`FailureClass::Retryable`](engine_core::error::FailureClass::Retryable) and that a
//! reconnect is in flight. The engine's job is to give it the inputs: the `connect()`
//! future, its `Ok`/`Err`, the [`FailureClass`](engine_core::error::FailureClass), the
//! [`ConnectionInfo`](crate::ConnectionInfo), and these steps.
//!
//! # What each adapter emits
//!
//! The asymmetry is the one [`ConnectionInfo`](crate::ConnectionInfo) already models: a
//! `reqwest` adapter cannot report a TLS version, and Graph has no connect exchange at
//! all.
//!
//! | Adapter | Steps |
//! |---|---|
//! | `provider-imap` | [`TlsEstablished`](ConnectStep::TlsEstablished) after the handshake, [`Authenticated`](ConnectStep::Authenticated) after `LOGIN`, [`Negotiated`](ConnectStep::Negotiated) after `CAPABILITY`/`ENABLE` |
//! | `provider-jmap` | [`Redirected`](ConnectStep::Redirected) per well-known hop, [`Authenticated`](ConnectStep::Authenticated) on the session `2xx`, [`Discovered`](ConnectStep::Discovered) with the `apiUrl` |
//! | `provider-caldav` | [`Redirected`](ConnectStep::Redirected) per hop, [`Discovered`](ConnectStep::Discovered) with the calendar-home href |
//! | `provider-graph` | nothing — `GraphClient::connect` performs no I/O |
