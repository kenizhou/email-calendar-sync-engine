//! The email streaming primitive: a pull [`Stream`] of [`EmailChunk`]s.
//!
//! This is the shape every mail adapter produces for a sync pass. It **decouples
//! two knobs a single page size used to conflate** (`store-and-sync.md`):
//!
//! - **fetch batching** — how many objects the adapter pulls per network round trip (an IMAP `UID
//!   FETCH` window, a JMAP `Email/get` page, a Graph `$top`);
//! - **streaming granularity** — how many objects it emits per [`EmailChunk`], the unit the
//!   orchestrator commits and reports.
//!
//! A large batch with a small chunk gives *both* few round trips *and*
//! row-as-it-arrives commits: an IMAP adapter parses `FETCH` responses off the wire
//! and yields a chunk every `chunk_size` messages **within** one batched fetch, so a
//! host surfaces mail before the whole batch has downloaded.
//!
//! Each chunk also carries how the orchestrator must apply it — a
//! [`PassMode`] (additive-and-resumable versus reconciling) and an optional
//! [`advance_to`](EmailChunk::advance_to) checkpoint cursor — so a killed cold sync
//! resumes from where it stopped rather than restarting (`store-and-sync.md`).
