//! [`Capabilities`] answers "what can this account do?"; [`ConnectionInfo`] answers
//! the wider question "what do we know about this connection now that it is up?" —
//! the capabilities *plus* the transport versions that were negotiated. It is the
//! one post-connect fact object a host reads (`providers.md`), so a host that wants
//! to show or log "IMAP over TLS 1.3" / "JMAP over HTTP/2" makes one call and
//! switches on no provider kind.
//!
//! The two version fields are **independently optional**, because the facts a
//! provider can observe are asymmetric (`docs/agent-guidance/tls.md`):
//!
//! - A `tokio-rustls` provider (IMAP/SMTP) knows its TLS version and has no HTTP version.
//! - A `reqwest` provider (JMAP/CalDAV/Graph/Google) knows both, and learns the TLS version only
//!   from a response: reqwest reports it on the `TlsInfo` extension the shared client asks for
//!   (`engine-tls`), so there is nothing to read until one response has come back.
//!
//! The TLS *policy* is deliberately absent: the host chose it and already knows it
//! (`docs/agent-guidance/tls.md`). This object carries only what the **server**
//! decided.
