//! The [`CalendarWrites`] half of the provider seam: creating, editing, answering and
//! deleting events.
//!
//! A supertrait of [`Provider`](crate::Provider) rather than more methods on it, so the
//! five verbs sit beside the types they take ([`EventDraft`], [`EventEdit`],
//! [`EventRsvp`], [`EventDeletion`]) instead of in a file that is otherwise about
//! syncing mail. Callers see no difference: a `P: Provider` exposes these exactly as
//! before, because the supertrait comes with the bound.
//!
//! Every verb defaults to rejecting, so an adapter that cannot write calendars states
//! that with an empty impl and a capability set that says the same
//! ([`Capabilities::calendar_writes`](crate::Capabilities::calendar_writes)). Reading
//! the capability first is the contract; the defaults are what make a caller that
//! forgets fail loudly rather than silently.
