//! Outbound calendar write shapes.
//!
//! These mirror the mail [`Draft`](crate::Draft)/[`SubmissionReceipt`](crate::SubmissionReceipt)
//! pair: serializable requests a caller stores as a durable outbox `PendingOp` payload
//! before the side effect, plus a receipt the outbox records on success.
//!
//! # The four neutral verbs, and the one that is not
//!
//! [`EventDraft`] (create), [`EventEdit`] (patch), [`EventDeletion`] (delete) and
//! [`EventRsvp`] (answer an invitation) are the spine, and every calendar adapter implements
//! all four. They carry **intent** — a title, a new start, which occurrence, yes or no — and
//! each adapter renders that intent in its own protocol. So a host never touches a
//! `RawIcal`, an href or an `ETag` to edit an event, and never switches on provider kind
//! (`providers.md`).
//!
//! [`EventRsvp`] is a verb of its own rather than an [`EventEdit`] of the attendee array for
//! a reason the bytes hide: answering an invitation makes the server **tell the organizer**,
//! and a patch does not. Graph, Google and every auto-scheduling CalDAV/JMAP server route it
//! through a distinct path; expressing it as an edit would change the same participant and
//! skip the scheduling silently.
//!
//! [`EventWrite`] is the exception, and is deliberately *not* part of that spine: it
//! replaces the whole stored document, which only a **document-oriented** transport has as
//! a verb (CalDAV `PUT`, RFC 4791 §5.3.2 — the client owns the bytes). A transport whose
//! update verb is already a patch (JMAP `CalendarEvent/set`) has no such thing and leaves
//! it unsupported. It exists because some operations are naturally expressed as a finished
//! document rather than a property patch — today, the iMIP RSVP primitive
//! (`provider_caldav::imip::set_my_partstat`), which rewrites *my* `PARTSTAT` inside the
//! stored iCalendar and hands back the bytes to store.
//!
//! # Never re-serialize the projection
//!
//! The engine's [`Event`] projection is deliberately lossy (`calendar-semantics.md`): it has
//! no room for the `RRULE`'s `BYSETPOS`, the attendees' `DELEGATED-FROM`, the `VALARM`s, the
//! embedded `VTIMEZONE`, the `X-` properties another client wrote. Rebuilding a stored event
//! from it to move the event by half an hour would silently delete every one of them — a
//! save that looks like it worked. So an **update is always a patch**, applied to the
//! provider-native payload as it was received: the adapter does the surgery over the stored
//! raw (CalDAV), or hands the patch to a server that does (JMAP). A create is the one place
//! a document is built from scratch, because there is nothing yet to lose.
//!
//! # The lost-update guard
//!
//! Every write names the revision the caller read — a patch and a delete through the
//! [`Event`] they were built from, a document write through its own guard — so a server can
//! refuse an edit built on a copy that has since moved on. **Whether it does is not
//! universal**: read
//! [`Capabilities::calendar_write_guard`](crate::Capabilities::calendar_write_guard) before
//! writing. Under [`WriteGuard::Absent`](crate::WriteGuard::Absent) a stale write silently
//! wins, so "the write succeeded" does not mean "no concurrent edit was lost".
