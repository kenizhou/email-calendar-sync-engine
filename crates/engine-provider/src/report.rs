//! Reporting a message as junk, not junk, or phishing.
//!
//! A report is **not** a keyword change wearing a different name, which is why it is
//! its own verb rather than a [`MailEdit`](crate::MailEdit) variant. Setting `$seen`
//! changes what one mailbox row says; reporting tells the *provider* something about
//! the message, and on one transport it leaves the account entirely. The same split
//! the calendar side draws between
//! [`patch_event`](crate::Provider::patch_event) and
//! [`rsvp_event`](crate::Provider::rsvp_event): an edit changes an object, an answer
//! makes the server tell someone.
//!
//! The four transports disagree about almost everything around it, so the capability
//! ([`ReportControls`]) carries the differences a host must know **before** it offers
//! the action:
//!
//! - **Which verdicts exist.** Gmail has no phishing concept at all — asking for one is a hard
//!   error, not a no-op — so "Report phishing" must be absent there rather than quietly filed as
//!   junk.
//! - **Whether the provider acknowledges the report** ([`ReportEvidence`]). Graph answers with a
//!   status; JMAP, IMAP and Gmail take a flag or a label and say nothing about what they do with
//!   it. A host writing "this is reported to your provider" over the second kind is claiming
//!   something the engine cannot back.
//!
//! Every transport **files the message** as part of a report — to the account's Junk
//! for [`ReportVerdict::Junk`] and [`ReportVerdict::Phishing`], back to the Inbox for
//! [`ReportVerdict::NotJunk`]. They differ only in *who* moves it, which is an
//! adapter concern rather than a caller's: Graph and Gmail file it server-side and
//! cannot be told not to, so [`MessageReport::destination`] is the mailbox the caller
//! *would* have moved it to, and the adapters that need it use it.
//!
//! No transport we speak adds the sender to a block list. Outlook's own "Report Junk"
//! dialog says it blocks the sender, and its **deprecated** `markAsJunk` did; the
//! `reportMessage` action that replaced it was observed not to (`graph.md`). If a
//! provider that blocks is ever added, that becomes a third field here, because it is
//! a promise the user has to be shown before they press the button — not a detail.
