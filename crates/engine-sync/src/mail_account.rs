//! One account's mail sync, folder fan-out included.
//!
//! **This is the only entrypoint for syncing an account's mail, and that is the point.** It used
//! to be a choice of four — a whole-account convenience, a streaming variant, and the two halves a
//! host drove itself — and the shipping client used only the two halves. Anything account-level
//! therefore had to be written into two functions that never call each other, and work put in the
//! convenience ran in the tests and nowhere else. The engine owns the fan-out now, so there is one
//! place for it and the tests drive what ships.
//!
//! Owning the fan-out is also what makes three things possible that a host driving it cannot do:
//! the account-level store steps run **once** instead of once per folder, the Inbox goes **first**
//! so the list the user is looking at fills before the archive, and the concurrency is **bounded**
//! rather than "every folder at once".
