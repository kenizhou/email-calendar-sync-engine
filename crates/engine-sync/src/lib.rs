//! `engine-sync` — sync orchestration.
//!
//! Step 4 ships the **thin per-scope loop** that drives one provider against one
//! store for one account's mail, exercising the full cycle the store contract
//! prescribes (`store-and-sync.md`):
//!
//! ```text
//! claim_sync_scope → provider fetch → project/derive → apply_sync_update → release
//! ```
//!
//! Per scope it claims the lease (getting the prior cursor), fetches the
//! normalized [`ScopeSync`], precomputes the
//! [`DerivedWrite`] with the pure `engine-core` projection *before* the store
//! call, commits the delta/snapshot atomically, and releases. A `StaleLease`
//! (the lease was superseded mid-flight — e.g. a suspended mobile worker resumed)
//! drops the lease, **re-claims with the fresh cursor, and recomputes**; it never
//! retries the stale write. Containers (mailboxes) sync before members (email),
//! the referential apply order the contract requires.
//!
//! The store owns tombstoning: a [`SyncUpdate::Snapshot`] tells it to remove local
//! rows (and their derived rows) absent from the present set; a delta removes the
//! listed keys. The loop only projects the *changed* objects.
//!
//! [`sync_mail`] is responsive by construction: it commits each email page as
//! it lands and reports [`SyncCommit`] to a [`SyncObserver`] for live "downloaded
//! Y of X" UI, advancing the cursor only on the final page.
//!
//! The full cross-scope orchestrator (dependency-ordered fan-out across many
//! scopes, the outbox workers, the tzdata-bump driver) is a later build step; this
//! is deliberately the minimal driver that proves the cycle end to end.
