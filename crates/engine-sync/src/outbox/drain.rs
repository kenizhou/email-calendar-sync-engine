//! The background drainer: the pass that finally attempts what the inline drivers
//! recorded and left behind.
//!
//! The inline drivers run one op at the moment a user asks for it. Anything that failed
//! stayed durably enqueued and nothing came back for it, so a write attempted without a
//! network silently never happened (issue #60). This is what comes back.
//!
//! **It claims only what it can run.** A pass reads the account's queue, keeps the ops
//! whose [`PendingOpKind`] it dispatches, and takes each one under a *targeted* claim. The
//! batch claim would lease whatever is runnable, including kinds this pass cannot
//! dispatch, and an op leased by a worker that will not resolve it is held for its whole
//! lease: the failure #202 removed from the inline path, which must not come back here.
//!
//! **Mail only, so far.** [`Draft`], [`MailEdit`] and [`MessageReport`] are complete in
//! the payload: the provider call takes the account and the request and nothing else. A
//! calendar patch or delete takes the `base` event *beside* the request, so draining one
//! means re-reading it from the store and re-applying the stored intent to it, which is
//! also the conflict recovery and is its own piece of work. Until then those ops stay
//! queued, untouched and counted as deferred, rather than being leased and abandoned.
