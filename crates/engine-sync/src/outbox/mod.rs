//! Outbox-mediated writes: mail submission and edits ([`mail`]), contact writes
//! ([`contact`]), and calendar writes ([`calendar`]).
//!
//! Every write is **durable before any provider side effect** (`north-star.md` Write
//! Contract): the driver records a [`PendingOp`] carrying the request, claims it under a
//! fenced [`OpLease`](engine_store::OpLease) (the shared [`enqueue_and_claim`]), performs
//! the provider call, and records the outcome under that lease. Mail stamps the generated
//! `Message-ID` so the sent copy reconciles when it later syncs back; a calendar write
//! records the event key so the next sync reconciles the new revision.
//!
//! **The payload is the intent, not the rendered bytes.** A calendar patch stores the
//! `EventEdit` — which occurrence, and what changed — rather than the document it produced,
//! so a retry after a conflict can re-apply it to a *freshly fetched* base instead of
//! re-sending an edit built on a copy the server has moved past. Which adapter renders it,
//! and how, is not the outbox's business.
//!
//! These are the thin per-op drivers — one op, claimed and resolved inline as
//! enqueue-and-claim, the verb's execution half, and a mark — and the
//! background drainer ([`drain_outbox`](drain::drain_outbox)) that replays the
//! ops an inline driver never finished. The drivers' payloads are tagged
//! intents ([`OutboxIntent`]); a row an upstream-shaped build wrote carries the
//! request itself, and the drainer decodes whichever shape the row is.

/// Writes to one resource serialize, so a driver whose resource is in flight must wait
/// rather than give up: a host marks a message read on open and archives it a moment
/// later, and the archive arrives inside the mark-read's round trip. The bound is an
/// upper limit on one provider round trip, not an expected wait — the common case
/// clears in one poll. It is measured as **elapsed** time rather than as a count of
/// polls, because each poll also costs a store round trip: on a device where a sync is
/// committing, that round trip waits on the writer and dwarfs [`RESOURCE_POLL`], so
/// counting polls would hold the caller for a multiple of this bound. Past it the op
/// stays durably enqueued and the caller is told which condition refused it.

/// returning the leased op ready to resolve. The shared head of every outbox driver
/// (`store-and-sync.md`): enqueue → claim, with the same fencing discipline as sync.
///
/// This is the **thin inline** primitive (the precedent `submit_mail` established): it
/// enqueues an op and claims it *right now* to resolve it in the same call. It claims
/// that op **by id**, so it leases nothing it will not resolve and nothing older can
/// starve it; a resource another op holds in flight is waited out up to
/// [`RESOURCE_WAIT`]. It is still not the background outbox worker: it runs only at the
/// moment of the enqueue, so an op it could not claim stays enqueued and unresolved,
/// and nothing retries it until a drainer exists.
