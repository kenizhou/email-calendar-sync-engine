//! Outbox-mediated writes: mail submission and edits ([`mail`]), and calendar writes
//! ([`calendar`]).
//!
//! Every write is **durable before any provider side effect** (`north-star.md` Write
//! Contract): the driver records a [`PendingOp`] carrying the request, claims it under a
//! fenced [`OpLease`](engine_store::OpLease) (the shared [`enqueue_and_claim`]), performs
//! the provider call, and records the outcome under that lease. Mail stamps the generated
//! `Message-ID` so the sent copy reconciles when it later syncs back; a calendar write
//! records the event key so the next sync reconciles the new revision.
//!
//! **The payload is the intent, not the rendered bytes.** A calendar patch stores the
//! `EventEdit` — which occurrence, and what changed — rather than the document it produced,
//! so a retry after a conflict can re-apply it to a *freshly fetched* base instead of
//! re-sending an edit built on a copy the server has moved past. Which adapter renders it,
//! and how, is not the outbox's business.
//!
//! These are the thin per-op drivers — one op, claimed and resolved inline. The background
//! worker that drains the outbox and honors `depends_on` chains is the later orchestrator.
