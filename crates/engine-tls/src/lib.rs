//! `engine-tls` — one TLS trust policy for every provider.
//!
//! The engine speaks TLS two ways: the hand-rolled IMAP/SMTP transport over
//! [`tokio_rustls`], and the HTTP providers (CalDAV/JMAP/Graph) over `reqwest`.
//! Left to their defaults these disagree on *what to trust* — bundled roots on one
//! side, the OS verifier on the other — and on which crypto backend to use. This
//! crate removes that split: a host declares one provider-neutral [`TlsPolicy`],
//! [`client_config`] realizes it into a single ring-backed [`rustls::ClientConfig`],
//! and [`TlsClientConfig`] hands the same trust decision to every provider as a
//! [`tokio_rustls::TlsConnector`] (IMAP/SMTP) or a preconfigured `reqwest` client
//! (the HTTP providers).
//!
//! # Trust model
//!
//! The default is the **bundled Mozilla root program** ([`webpki_roots`]) —
//! hermetic and identical on every platform. A host may instead (or additionally)
//! trust the OS store, mirroring Firefox's *bundled ∪ OS* union, or pin an explicit
//! set of roots. See `docs/agent-guidance/tls.md` for the full policy and the
//! per-platform guidance.
//!
//! # Crypto provider
//!
//! Every config is built with an explicit [`ring`](rustls::crypto::ring) provider,
//! so the workspace carries one crypto backend rather than mixing `ring` and
//! `aws-lc-rs`.
