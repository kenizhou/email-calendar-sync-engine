//! The commands that go through the **real** [`CalDavProvider`].
//!
//! That is the whole point of this tool, and the reason it lives in the workspace rather than
//! beside the detached OAuth helpers: what it prints is what the engine does. A debugging tool
//! with its own HTTP client and its own iCalendar parser answers questions about *itself* —
//! and will happily report a server behaviour the adapter never sees, or miss one it does.
//!
//! The one deliberate exception is [`crate::raw`], which is labelled as being outside the
//! adapter precisely because some questions (a scheduling-inbox `PROPFIND`, a `.well-known`
//! redirect) cannot be asked through a typed calendar API at all.
