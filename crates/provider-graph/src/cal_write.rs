//! Calendar writes: `create_event` (POST), `patch_event` (PATCH), `delete_event`
//! (DELETE), all guarded by the `If-Match` ETag — so Graph advertises
//! [`WriteGuard::Enforced`](engine_provider::WriteGuard::Enforced), unlike JMAP.
//!
//! Like JMAP (and unlike CalDAV), **the server does the surgery**: a Graph `PATCH`
//! merges a partial event, so a [`patch_event`] translates the neutral
//! [`EventEdit`] *intent* into a partial event JSON and never re-serializes the lossy
//! projection (`calendar-semantics.md`). A create is the one write built from scratch.
