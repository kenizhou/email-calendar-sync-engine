//! The [`Provider`] implementation: a Microsoft Graph client bound to one mail
//! folder for email, with the folder list synced at the account level.
//!
//! Graph mail `delta` is per-folder (`jmap.md`/this crate's docs), so — like
//! `provider-imap` — a [`GraphProvider`] is bound to a single folder: its
//! [`email_scope`](Provider::email_scope) names that folder
//! ([`SyncScope::GraphFolder`]) and [`stream_email`](Provider::stream_email)
//! streams its `messages/delta`. The folder list syncs under the per-account
//! [`SyncScope::GraphFolderList`]. The cross-folder fan-out is the orchestrator's
//! job.
