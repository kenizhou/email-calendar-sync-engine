//! `engine-api` — the stable facade hosts consume (`north-star.md`).
//!
//! Every host — mobile (UniFFI), desktop/daemon (the C ABI), the CLI, and server
//! adapters — drives the engine through this one crate instead of wiring
//! `engine-store`, `engine-sync`, the providers, and a clock together itself. The
//! facade owns that composition: an [`Engine`] holds one durable
//! [`SqliteStore`](store_sqlite::SqliteStore) (the first store; other backends are
//! host adapters) driven by the host wall clock (`SystemClock`), and exposes
//! high-level operations over it.
//!
//! # Scope of this slice
//!
//! Step 6 of the build order lands in small, tested slices. These cover **store
//! lifecycle** ([`Engine::open`], [`Engine::open_in_memory`]), **provider-driven
//! sync** ([`Engine::sync_mail`], [`Engine::sync_calendar`]), **per-account
//! search** ([`Engine::search_mail`], [`Engine::search_calendar`]),
//! **outbox-mediated mail submission** ([`Engine::submit_mail`],
//! [`Engine::pending_op_state`]), **streaming mail sync**
//! ([`Engine::sync_mail`], which streams each folder and fans them out itself, for
//! concurrent cross-folder sync), and **outbox-mediated calendar writes**
//! ([`Engine::create_calendar_event`], [`Engine::patch_calendar_event`],
//! [`Engine::delete_calendar_event`]) — which carry *intent*, so the same call drives
//! CalDAV and JMAP and the host never assembles a protocol payload, and which
//! **reconcile the store to the server's copy before they return**, so a host can
//! re-read what it just wrote (and guard its next edit on the revision the server
//! actually reported). The language bindings themselves are a deliberate follow-up slice.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! - The store is concrete ([`SqliteStore`](store_sqlite::SqliteStore)): SQLite is the engine's
//!   first store, and the search and other conveniences live on it, not on the
//!   `engine_store::Store` trait.
//! - Sync is **generic over [`Provider`]**, so the facade stays provider-agnostic — a host passes a
//!   `provider-jmap`, `provider-imap`, or `provider-caldav` adapter and the facade never switches
//!   on protocol.
//! - The wall clock lives here, not in `engine-store`, so the store keeps a single injected time
//!   seam and never reads the system clock itself (`north-star.md`).
//!
//! The types that appear in the facade's own signatures are re-exported, so a host
//! can depend on `engine-api` alone and still name everything it needs to call it.
