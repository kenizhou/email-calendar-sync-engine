//! The outbox-mediated **calendar** writes on `Engine` — create, patch, replace-document,
//! RSVP, delete — each of which reconciles the store to the server's copy before it
//! returns.
//!
//! # Read-your-writes
//!
//! A calendar write returns a receipt, not a document: a CalDAV `PUT` answers with an
//! `ETag` and no body, a JMAP `CalendarEvent/set` with an id and no object. The driver
//! underneath these methods therefore leaves the store holding the **pre-write** event —
//! the old projection, the old `raw_ical`, the old revision (issue #65). A host that then
//! re-read the store would see the event it just replaced, and — worse — would build its
//! *next* edit's guard from the **superseded** revision and be refused with a `412` on a
//! write that should have succeeded.
//!
//! So every write here runs [`engine_sync::reconcile_calendar_events`] — an event-scope
//! delta, one round trip on either transport — the moment the write lands. The store then
//! holds what the **server** holds (never the bytes we sent: see the `engine_sync::calendar`
//! module docs for why storing our own copy would mask a server that silently dropped a
//! property), a delete is tombstoned locally instead of lingering until the next sync, and
//! an edit that moved the event moves its occurrence rows.
//!
//! The reconcile is a *local* step after a write the server has already accepted, so it
//! can never fail the write: it is reported as [`Reconciled`], not as an error.
