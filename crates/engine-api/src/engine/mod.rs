//! The [`Engine`]: a host's entry point to one account store.
//!
//! The methods are grouped across sibling modules to keep each file small:
//! provider-driven sync and cache maintenance (`sync`), the read and search surface
//! (`reads`), the outbox-mediated mail writes (`writes`), the calendar writes, which
//! additionally reconcile the store to the server's copy (`calendar_writes`), and the
//! outbox drains that replay ops no write resolved (`drain`). This module holds the type
//! itself, its lifecycle constructors, the shared per-domain scope helper, and the
//! sync-error mapping every group reuses.
