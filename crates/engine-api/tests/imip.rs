//! `Engine::message_scheduling` against a **real server-authored iMIP invitation**.
//!
//! The inline tests beside the read use invitations we wrote ourselves, which proves the
//! logic but not the shape: every hand-written fixture is a guess about what arrives. This
//! one is the message Stalwart **generated and mailed** when an organizer stored an event
//! naming an attendee — captured from the harness, trimmed only in two body payloads
//! (`tests/fixtures/README.md`), and it is a good deal nastier than the guesses:
//!
//! - the `text/calendar` part sits at the top level of a `multipart/mixed`, a sibling of a
//!   `multipart/related` wrapping a `multipart/alternative` and an inline PNG — three levels away
//!   from where an iMIP body part is "supposed" to be;
//! - it is **quoted-printable**, so the payload arrives as `=0D=0A`/`=3D` escapes;
//! - its Windows `TZID` is **DQUOTE-quoted** *and* QP-escaped (`TZID=3D"W. Europe Standard Time"`);
//! - its `ATTENDEE` line is folded **mid-`mailto:`** — `mailt`, CRLF, ` o:carol@…`;
//! - and it carries `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="event.ics"`.
//!
//! The live counterpart is `provider-caldav/tests/scheduling/mod.rs`, which drives the same
//! exchange against the running server; this keeps the observed bytes in the offline suite.
